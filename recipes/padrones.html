        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Some like it hot, as the saying goes, but those heat-seekers better also be gamblers if they're looking to pimientos de Padrón to stoke their flames: Only about one in ten of the small green peppers from the Spanish municipality of Padrón, in Galicia, are wildly hot, while the rest are as mild as a green bell pepper.</p>

            <p>The exciting part is that it's pretty much impossible to tell them apart until you actually put one in your mouth. It's part of what makes eating them so damn exciting, though I gotta admit: I love their flavor so much that I'd be perfectly content knocking back a bowl without the added adrenaline of a game of capsicum roulette.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 tablespoon</strong> extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Packet of Padrón peppers</li>
                <li>Sea salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil over high heat in a cast iron skillet large enough to fit the peppers in a single layer. Heat until lightly smoking, then add peppers. Cook without moving until blistered on first side, about 30 seconds. Flip and shake the peppers and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until well blistered all over and tender-crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes total. Season with salt.</li>
                <li>Transfer peppers to a serving plate. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with more coarse salt. Serve immediately. </li>
            </ol>
